## Lab XY - Taking Control of a Project as admin - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### MONDAY

### Lab Objective

Now that Alice Anderson and Bob Barker have been added to the project space Acme Inc, we want to sign in as those users and confirm that they can launch instances (create infastructure). The marketing department would call this, "Infastructure As A Service", and is the product Acme Inc is paying us for.

### Procedure

0. Log out of bobbarker, and log back in as admin.

0. **Navigate to Admin > System > Instances > Instance Name: acme_vm2 > Log Tab**

0. Study the log file and answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: What is the default username associated with this cirrOS image?**
      - A1: cirros
    - **Q2: What is the password associated with this user?**
      - A2: cubswin:)
    
0. **Click on Admin > System > Instances**

0. Check all the tick boxes beside the running instances. **Click  'Delete Instances'**. All instances should begin shutting down.

0. Once more log out of admin, and log back in as aliceanderson or bobbarker.

    > The acme_inc project should once again have no instances running. Check the Project > Compute > Overview dashboard and the Project > Compute > Instances dashboard to be sure. 
 
    > Deleting an instance will kill the instance (forever)  

    > In this case, the *admin* user deleted a machine created by *bobbarker*. You may be wondering why bobbarker did not delete the machine that he created, and indeed that is normally how it is done. In this case, we just wanted to show you thad admin has access to manipulate VMs across projects (tenant) spaces.
