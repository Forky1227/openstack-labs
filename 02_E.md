#### Taking control with admin

0. Log out of bobbarker, and log back in as admin.

0. **Navigate to Admin > System > Instances > Instance Name: acme_vm2 > Log Tab**

0. Study the log file and answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: What is the default username associated with this cirrOS image?**
      - A1: cirros
    - **Q2: What is the password associated with this user?**
      - A2: cubswin:)
    
0. **Click on Admin > System > Instances**

0. Check all the tick boxes beside the running instances. **Click  'Delete Instances'**. All instances should begin shutting down.

0. Once more log out of admin, and log back in as aliceanderson or bobbarker.

    > The acme_inc project should once again have no instances running. Check the Project > Compute > Overview dashboard and the Project > Compute > Instances dashboard to be sure. 
 
    > Deleting an instance will kill the instance (forever)  

    > In this case, the *admin* user deleted a machine created by *bobbarker*. You may be wondering why bobbarker did not delete the machine that he created, and indeed that is normally how it is done. In this case, we just wanted to show you thad admin has access to manipulate VMs across projects (tenant) spaces.

##### 6. Misc

0. Session timeout setting
    > If the 2 minute timeout is annoyingly short, you can change the Openstack timeout following this suggestion: https://ask.openstack.org/en/question/32206/horizon-session-timeout/

    > **SESSION_TIMEOUT**- This SESSION_TIMEOUT is a method to supercede the token timeout with a shorter horizon session timeout (in seconds). So if your token expires in 60 minutes, a value of 1800 will log users out after 30 minutes.
