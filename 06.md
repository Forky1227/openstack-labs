## Lab XY - Creating new public and private flavors at the CLI  - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### TUESDAY

### Lab Objective

Think of a flavor as the virtual hardware set presented to the guest OS. In real world terms, a 'small' flavor might only have the power of a $25 Raspberry Pi, whereas a a 'large' flavor might be more comporable to a $5000 Workstation. OpenStack comes with some default flavors, which we will explore, as well as learn to create our own custom flavors.

Flavors can be publically available (all projects have access to them), or created as private (restrited to only certain projects). So in addition to creating a public flavor, we'll explore applying access controls to some private flavors.

### Procedure

0. SSH to your controller as student:

    `[student@beachhead ~]#` `ssh controller`

0. Run help on the openstack python-client, and review the usage. For now, pay special attention to the flavor commands. You can run help by typing the following:

    `[root@controller ~]#` `source admin.rc`

	`root@controller admin >` `openstack help | less`

    > For students who do not have much experience using the less command:
    - **Press q to quit -** Exit Less utility and return to the CLI
    - **Press CTRL + F -** Forward one window
    - **Press CTRL + B -** Back one window
    - Less utility cheat sheet (http://sheet.shiar.nl/less)

0. Wow! That took a lot of scrolling to find the flavor commands. Let's augment that command so it is easier to find what we are looking for.

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack help | grep flavor`

0. Much better! Now, use openstack flavor list to see what default flavors are installed with Openstack. When you see these, the concept of 'resources' should become more clear.

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor list`

    ```
    +----+-----------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    | ID | Name      |   RAM | Disk | Ephemeral | VCPUs | Is Public |

    | 2  | m1.small  |  2048 |   20 |         0 |     1 | True      |
    | 3  | m1.medium |  4096 |   40 |         0 |     2 | True      |
    | 4  | m1.large  |  8192 |   80 |         0 |     4 | True      |
    | 5  | m1.xlarge | 16384 |  160 |         0 |     8 | True      |
    +----+-----------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    ```	
	
0. Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: How many more VCPUs does m1.xlarge have over m1.tiny?**
      - A1: 7! m1.xlarge has 8, m1.tiny only has 1
    - **Q2: How much more memory does m1.xlarge have over m1.tiny?**
      - A2: 15872 more, or about 15.5 GB more RAM
    - **Q3: What do you think Is Public means?**
      - A3: It is possible a specific tenant might require access to a 'custom' flavor that we don't want other users to see. Such a flavor could be created with specific ACL permissions inplace, so that only certain tenants might see it. Such a protected flavor would have a Is_Public value of False.
	
0. Maybe all of our customers want access to a specific flavor; one with 512 Mb of RAM, 2 Gb disk, 1 VCPU, and named **"custom.shrimpy"**. We can do that with the following command:

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor create --id 6 --ram 512 --disk 2 --vcpu 1 --public custom.shrimpy`

    - **Q1: Look at the command you just copy & pasted. The values 512 (Mb of RAM), and 2 (Gb disk), and 1 (VCPU) should be clear, but why was the value of 6 included?**
      - A1: If you run the openstack flavor list command, you'll see that the flavors are indexed by integers. Supplying --id 6, is a label to referece the new custom.shrimy. This is still unclear, run the command **openstack flavor create --help**	
	
0. Look for **custom.shrimpy** on the flavor list as multiple users. What we are illustrating, is that this is a publicly available flavor.

    `root@controller admin >` `nova flavor-list`

0. Switch to the user aliceanderson.

    `root@controller admin >` `source alice.rc`

0. Confirm Alice (project acme_inc) can see the custom public flavor, custom.shrimpy.

    `root@controller alice >` `openstack flavor list`

0. Switch to the user chestercopperpot.
 
    `root@controller admin >` `source chester.rc`

0. Confirm Chester (project vault_tek) can see the custom public flavor, custom.shrimpy.

   `root@controller chester >` `openstack flavor list`
	
0. Alice Anderson and Bob Barker from the project acme_inc just sent you a request. Occasionally they would like to create a 'monster' VM that is uniquely tuned for some code they are writing, one with 128 GB of RAM. This is a unique request, so We want Alice and her team to have access to this instance, but not our other customers. If we create a new public flavor, all users in all projects would have access to it, so instead, we'll create a private flavor with restricted access.

0. Issue the openstack flavor create --help command.

    `root@controller chester >` `openstack flavor create --help`

0. Review the output, then answer the following questions:
    - **Q1: Is RAM described in Mb or Gb?**
      - A1: Mb
    - **Q2: Is a disk size described in Gb or Mb?**
      - A2: Gb
    - **Q3: Is the default value for a newly created flavor public or private?"
      - public
	
0. Take on admin permissions.

    `root@controller chester >` `source admin.rc`
    
0. Create a new flavor as private, and see what happens.

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor create --id 7 --ram 1250000 --disk 10 --vcpu 8 --private secret.monster`
    
0. Great, time to see the results!
    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor list`
 
    - **Q1: Do you see the new private flavor listed? Why or why not?**
      - A1: No. When you create a flavor as private, it will remain 'hidden' unless we order Openstack to reveal a private flavor to a perticular user. Alternatively, we can commands Openstack to reveal **all** flavors, although this may only be done with admin privledges.

0. Let us make sure that secret.monster was actually created. Type the following command to see both the public AND private flavor.

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor list --all`

    ```

0. We need to tell OpenStack what projects should gain access to this project. However, there is a problem with the openstack python-client we are issuing commands through... it is not yet complete! That is to say, there is no command that allows a user to alter flavor permissions. Remember, the openstack python-client is attempting to unify commands from across many python-clients. One day this work will be done, and we can just open commands that start with **openstack**, but for now, we occasionally need to reach for an alternative client. To confirm all of this is true, type the following to review the commands assocaited with flavor that the openstack python-client may issue:

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack help | grep flavor`
	
    ```
  flavor create  Create new flavor
  flavor delete  Delete flavor
  flavor list    List flavors
  flavor set     Set flavor properties
  flavor show    Display flavor details
  flavor unset   Unset flavor properties
  messaging flavor create  Create a pool flavor
  messaging flavor delete  Delete a flavor
  messaging flavor list  List available flavors
  messaging flavor show  Display flavor details
  messaging flavor update  Update a flavor's attributes
  server resize  Scale server to a new flavor
    ```  
    
0. Hmm, none of those look appropriate... so, query commands available to the nova python-client.

    `root@controller admin >` `nova help | grep flavor`
    
    ```
    flavor-access-add           Add flavor access for the given tenant.
    flavor-access-list          Print access information about the given
                                flavor.
    flavor-access-remove        Remove flavor access for the given tenant.
    flavor-create               Create a new flavor.
    flavor-delete               Delete a specific flavor
    flavor-key                  Set or unset extra_spec for a flavor.
    flavor-list                 Print a list of available 'flavors' (sizes of
    flavor-show                 Show details about the given flavor.
    ```

0. Looks like we need a **flavor-access-add** command. Issue the following command, and remember the old name for project was tenant:

    `root@controller admin >` `nova help flavor-access-add`

	```
    Add flavor access for the given tenant.
	
    Positional arguments:
    <flavor>     Flavor name or ID to add access for the given tenant.
    <tenant_id>  Tenant ID to add flavor access for.
    ```

0. Discover the admin's project ID (ID)
	
	`root@controller admin >` `openstack project list` 

	```
	+----------------------------------+---------------+
	| ID                               | Name          |

	+----------------------------------+---------------+
	```

0. Copy the **admin ID** 

    `root@controller admin >` `nova flavor-access-add 7 REPLACE_WITH_ID`  <-- replace with **admin project ID** from above

    >You have just allowed the tenant admin access to flavor #7, secret.monster. This is why admin can now see the flavor

0. Admin should now be able to see the private flavor without including the **--all** argument

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor list`

     ```
    +----+----------------+---------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    | ID | Name           |     RAM | Disk | Ephemeral | VCPUs | Is Public |
    +----+----------------+---------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    | 1  | m1.tiny        |     512 |    1 |         0 |     1 | True      |
    | 2  | m1.small       |    2048 |   20 |         0 |     1 | True      |
    | 3  | m1.medium      |    4096 |   40 |         0 |     2 | True      |

    | 6  | custom.shrimpy |     512 |    2 |         0 |     1 | True      |
    | 7  | secret.monster | 1250000 |   10 |         0 |     8 | False     |
    +----+----------------+---------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    ```

0. If using the nova python-client feels a bit odd, remember that at this time, only the keystone python-client has been fully deprecated. Review the following documentation to confirm this is the case: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackClients

0. Give Alice's project (Acme Inc) access to the flavor as well. Discover the project ID of Acme Inc. 

   `root@controller admin >` `openstack project list` <-- Discover the project ID of Acme Inc  

   ```
   +----------------------------------+---------------+
   | ID                               | Name          |
   +----------------------------------+---------------+
   | 1bc66b9ab9a24814bba5438d2db74147 | admin         |
   | 3912a08ca34f4507a078198e0227a5da | acme_inc      | <--- USE THIS ID BELOW!
   | 431ce679d770497e90c308e58c32de0b | alta3         |
   | 4859363384de40b3b3bb152fefbee9ae | demo          |

   | 6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645 | vault_tek     |
   | 712e8501dd204df188c64f44bd81093d | service       |
   +----------------------------------+---------------+
   ```  

0. Give acme_inc access to flavor secret.monster
	
	`root@controller admin >` `nova flavor-access-add 7 REPLACE_WITH_ID`  <-- replace with **acme_inc project ID** from above

0. Check out if you were successfull!
	
    `root@controller admin >` `source alice.rc`

    `root@controller alice >` `openstack flavor list`
    
    >Alice Anderson should see the presence of secret.monster displayed, as the project acme_inc was given access to the flavor  

0. Find out if Chester Copperpot (a tenant of VaultTek) can see the project.
 
    `root@controller alice >#` `source chester.rc`

    `root@controller chester >` `openstack flavor list`
	
    >Failed? Good! The user chestercopperpot is a member of the VaultTek project, and VaultTek has not been given access to the flavor secret.monster.

#### 3. Launching instances from the CLI

0. Let's try launching some instances from the CLI.

0. See what flavor, images, and networks are available for use. Type the following commands:

    `root@controller chester >` `openstack flavor list`

    `root@controller chester >` `opesntack image list`

    `root@controller chester >` `neutron net-list`
	
    ![net-id](https://i.imgur.com/lw5dWeS.png)

0. There are a few things we have not studied yet that we are working with here. We have not studied networking yet. Normally, we would first create a network for a tenant, and then launch that instance within that tenant's private network. We can study that later, for now, copy the UUID assocaited with the of the private network (it was revealed with the command **neutron net-list**).
 
0. Boot an instance called vt1 with the flavor custom.shrimpy, from the image cirros, and place it on the fabric network (more on networking is coming up)

	> NOTE: Instances typically will be placed on their own tenant network, and include a 'security group' (a set of IP rules); things we haven't yet studied (we'll get there in subsequent labs). Launching an instance without defining a security group, will result in using the 'default' security group, which denies all incoming traffic.

    `root@controller chester >` `openstack server create --flavor custom.shrimpy --image cirros --nic net-id=<xxxxxxxxxxxx> vt1`
 
    > where `<xxxxxxxxx>` = the internal private_network_id that you cut and paste from the above command `neutron net-list`

 * What is the task state?
 * What ID was this instance assigned?
 * What tenant does this instance belong to?
 * What name was this instance given?
 * What image was used to boot this instance? 
 
0. Display a list of the running instances within the current tenant

    `root@controller chester >` `openstack server list`
    
 * What is the status?
 * What is the power state?
 * Hint: Issue the command again in a few minutes if they do not say "ACTIVE" and "Running" respectively.

0. Display information only about the running instance vt1 that was just created:

    `root@controller chester >` `openstack server show vt1`

0. Log into the Horizon dashboard interface as `default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd` then navigate to:

 * Navigate to: Project > Compute > Instances
 * You've had some experience clicking around in Horizon instances before. Do it again! If nothing else, check out the log and console tabs for the instance.
 * This found by clicking on the instance name (vt1), then clicking on the log tab (or console tab).
	
0. That's it for this lab! We'll continue to explore manipulating instances, but feel free to exploring launching instances from the CLI or Horizon, or checking out other Nova commands while you wait.
