## Lab XY - Creating a Project and Adding Users at the CLI - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### MONDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to teach how to create a project and user at the CLI (same as we did in Horizon). Now let's get back to our story. Time to take a second order.

   - **Order 2:** Vault Tek would like one user, Chester Copperpot, to be able to admin a small cloud for their company.

### Procedure

0. SSH to your controller as root.

0. Apply the admin access variables to the bash environment. This will prevent you from issuing needlessly long CLI commands. This is covered more extensively in another lesson.

    `[root@controller]#` `source admin.rc`

0.  Keystone's job is management of users and credentials. Issue this command to the keystone service to create a new tenant.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack project create --domain default vault_tek`

0. Create the user chestercopperpot, within the tenant (project) vault_tek, the password fa5tpa55w0rd, and the email address chester@example.com

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack user create --project vault_tek --password fa5tpa55w0rd --email chester@vaulttek.example --domain default chestercopperpot`

    > If this command is successfully run, you should see output similar to below:

    ``` 
    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    | Field              | Value                            |
    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    | default_project_id | 6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645 |
    | domain_id          | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
    | email              | chester@vaulttek.com             |
    | enabled            | True                             |
    | id                 | bbd00ac0ce7c410198ffcac13d26932c |
    | name               | chestercopperpot                 |
    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    ```

0. Display the tenants (projects) currently available. 

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack project list`
	
    > The results look like this and are analogous to the Identity > Projects page in the Horizon dashboard.

    ```

    ```

0. Display the users that have been created in the system. 

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack user list`

    > The results look like this:

0. Log in to the **Horizon interface** as `default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`

 * If you have forgotten how to get to Horizon, simply navigate to your FQDN in a web browser 
 
0. Once logged in, you should be part of the new project called vault_tek.

   - **Q1: How can you quickly identify the project that you are a part of in Horizon?**
      - A1: Look in the upper left corner of Horizon.
 
 0. We logged into Horizon in the previous lab, but if you are new to OpenStack, click around, and make sure everything appears as you would expect it to within the OpenStack Horizon dashboard.
