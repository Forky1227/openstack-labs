### Lab 00 - Student Setup - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Welcome to the Alta3 OpenStack Labs! Before we get started, let's review some basics:

Each lab is structured with a *Title*, *Lab Objective*, and *Procedure*.

   - **Title** - Indicates if this lab is Required, Optional (Basic), or Optional (Advanced)
      - **Required - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;** - Marked with a Gold Star emoji. Everyone must do these labs! These labs build on one another, so don't skip any!
      - **Optional (Basic) - &#x1F528;OPTIONAL&#x1F528;** - Marked with a Hammer emoji. Do these labs if you are new to Linux or the Command Line Interface. Failure to do this labs by inexperienced users is garunteed to cause greater problems in other labs!
      - **Optional (Advanced) - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;** - Marked with a Rocket Ship emoji. Do these labs if you're a Rocket Scientist and are looking for more than just the basics (i.e. "You're a wizard Harry")
   - **Lab Objective** - The ultimate goal of the procedure.
   - **Procedure** - Numbered steps to follow.

The objective of this lab is to instruct students on how to access their lab environment from a Windows, Linux, or Apple platform. All you will need to perform the labs is a browser. The flavor of the browser is upto you, but if you have any issues, it is recommended you first switch to Chrome or Firefox.

### Procedure

0. Here is your OpenStack lab environment: 

	![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3-cloud-nets-001.png)

0. While **holding down the control key**, click the following link to gain access to your remote desktop "beachhead". https://alta3.com/beachhead
    
0. You should be connected to a screen that looks like the following:

	![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3-cloud-nets-001.png)

0. You now need to sign into your remote desktop environment. The sign-in name, and password will be provided by your instructor. Keep note of these, they will not change for the remainder of the course.

0. Now that you are signed in, we recommend you tap **F11** to place yourself in full-screen mode. This is where the second monitor will come in handy.
   > If you tap F11 and nothing happens, you're likely using Microsoft Edge (the 'new' version of Internet Explorer). For whatever reason, Microsoft has decided that full screen mode isn't a necessary feature. This is one of many reasons we recommend, if at all possible, you switch browers to Firefox or Chrome.
 
0. Answer the following questions to confirm that you understand the lab environment:
    - **Q1: How many browser tabs will you have open to do these labs?**
      - A1: Three. One for the lab manual (https://alta3.com/labs/openstack), one for terminal access (https://alta3.com/sshproxy), and one for Horion (https://**LAST_NAME**.alta3.training)
    - **Q2: When you are asked to connect via command line, will everyone use the same URL?  If so, what is it?**
      - Q2: Yes. Everyone will use (https://alta3.com/sshproxy) as a 'hop of point' into the CLI of their own controller.
    - **Q3: When you connect to OpenStack Horizon, what URL will you browse? (Hint, find your name on the table above)**
      - Q3: The OpenStack Horizon Dashboard is available via (https://**YOUR_LAST_NAME_HERE**.alta3.training)
    - **Q4: How many nodes are in your OpenStack lab environment?**
      - Q4: Four - Controller, Networking, Compute1, and Compute2
    - **Q5: Where will VMs run?**
      - Q5: VMs will always run on compute nodes, never on the Controller or Networking nodes.
