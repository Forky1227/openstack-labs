### Lab Duration: 60 minutes

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to launch an instance from the CLI (utilizing the Nova service). When an instance is launched, it is assigned a flavor, which is a set of resources. Flavors can be of the type public, or private, so we'll study both.

#### 1. Creating new (public) flavors at the CLI

0. SSH to your controller as root, you might use:

 * While holding the control key, click: (https://alta3.com/sshproxy)

0. Run help on the openstack python-client, and review the usage. For now, pay special attention to the flavor commands. You can run help by typing the following:

    `[root@controller ~]#` `source admin.rc`

	`root@controller admin >` `openstack help | less`

    > For students who do not have much experience using the less command:
    - **Press q to quit -** Exit Less utility and return to the CLI
    - **Press CTRL + F -** Forward one window
    - **Press CTRL + B -** Back one window
    - Less utility cheat sheet (http://sheet.shiar.nl/less)

0. Wow! That took a lot of scrolling to find the flavor commands. Let's augment that command so it is easier to find what we are looking for.

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack help | grep flavor`

0. Much better! Now, use openstack flavor list to see what default flavors are installed with Openstack. When you see these, the concept of 'resources' should become more clear.

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor list`

    ```
    +----+-----------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    | ID | Name      |   RAM | Disk | Ephemeral | VCPUs | Is Public |
    +----+-----------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    | 1  | m1.tiny   |   512 |    1 |         0 |     1 | True      |
    | 2  | m1.small  |  2048 |   20 |         0 |     1 | True      |
    | 3  | m1.medium |  4096 |   40 |         0 |     2 | True      |
    | 4  | m1.large  |  8192 |   80 |         0 |     4 | True      |
    | 5  | m1.xlarge | 16384 |  160 |         0 |     8 | True      |
    +----+-----------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    ```	
	
0. Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: How many more VCPUs does m1.xlarge have over m1.tiny?**
      - A1: 7! m1.xlarge has 8, m1.tiny only has 1
    - **Q2: How much more memory does m1.xlarge have over m1.tiny?**
      - A2: 15872 more, or about 15.5 GB more RAM
    - **Q3: What do you think Is Public means?**
      - A3: It is possible a specific tenant might require access to a 'custom' flavor that we don't want other users to see. Such a flavor could be created with specific ACL permissions inplace, so that only certain tenants might see it. Such a protected flavor would have a Is_Public value of False.
	
0. Maybe all of our customers want access to a specific flavor; one with 512 Mb of RAM, 2 Gb disk, 1 VCPU, and named **"custom.shrimpy"**. We can do that with the following command:

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor create --id 6 --ram 512 --disk 2 --vcpu 1 --public custom.shrimpy`

    - **Q1: Look at the command you just copy & pasted. The values 512 (Mb of RAM), and 2 (Gb disk), and 1 (VCPU) should be clear, but why was the value of 6 included?**
      - A1: If you run the openstack flavor list command, you'll see that the flavors are indexed by integers. Supplying --id 6, is a label to referece the new custom.shrimy. This is still unclear, run the command **openstack flavor create --help**	
	
0. Look for **custom.shrimpy** on the flavor list as multiple users. What we are illustrating, is that this is a publicly available flavor.

    `root@controller admin >` `nova flavor-list`
	
	```
        +----+----------------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
	| ID | Name           |   RAM | Disk | Ephemeral | VCPUs | Is Public |
	+----+----------------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
	| 1  | m1.tiny        |   512 |    1 |         0 |     1 | True      |
	| 2  | m1.small       |  2048 |   20 |         0 |     1 | True      |
	| 3  | m1.medium      |  4096 |   40 |         0 |     2 | True      |
	| 4  | m1.large       |  8192 |   80 |         0 |     4 | True      |
	| 5  | m1.xlarge      | 16384 |  160 |         0 |     8 | True      |
	| 6  | custom.shrimpy |   512 |    2 |         0 |     1 | True      |
	+----+----------------+-------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
	```

0. Switch to the user Alice Anderson, and confirm she can see the flavor. Type the following:

    `root@controller admin >` `source alice.rc`

    `root@controller alice >` `openstack flavor list`

0. Switch to the user Chester Copperpot, and confirm he can see the flavor. Type the following: 
 
	`root@controller admin >` `source chester.rc`

    `root@controller chester >` `openstack flavor list`
	
#### 2. Creating new (private) flavors at the CLI

Alice Anderson and her team from tenant acme_inc might need a custom flavor that is uniquely tuned for a project she is working on. For example, Alice's team needs to occasionally render video on a 'monster' instance with 125 GB of memory. We want Alice and her team to have access to this instance, but not our other customers.  If we create a new flavor as described above, the user would have access to the custom flavor, but so would all other tenants in the cloud. Giving everyone access to a 'monster' flavor might not be desirable. Customers not requiring (or paying) for the 'monster' flavor might drive our cloud into full capacity rather quickly. To prevent this, lets restrict access to the custom flavor.

0. If you haven't done so before, issue the openstack flavor create --help command.

    `root@controller chester >` `openstack flavor create --help`

0. Review the output, then answer the following questions:
    - **Q1: Is RAM described in Mb or Gb?**
      - A1: Mb
    - **Q2: Is a disk size described in Gb or Mb?**
      - A2: Gb
    - **Q3: Is the default value for a newly created flavor public or private?"
      - public
	
0. Notice that a flavor may also have an argument that sets the flavor to private. Let's become admin, then create a new flavor as private, and see what happens.

    `root@controller chester >` `source admin.rc`
	
    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor create --id 7 --ram 1250000 --disk 10 --vcpu 8 --private secret.monster`
    
0. Great, time to see the results!
    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor list`
 
    - **Q1: Do you see the new private flavor listed? Why or why not?**
      - A1: No. When you create a flavor as private, it will remain 'hidden' unless we order Openstack to reveal a private flavor to a perticular user. Alternatively, we can commands Openstack to reveal **all** flavors, although this may only be done with admin privledges.

0. Let us make sure that secret.monster was actually created. Type the following command to see both the public AND private flavor.

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack flavor list --all`

    ```
    +----+----------------+---------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    | ID | Name           |     RAM | Disk | Ephemeral | VCPUs | Is Public |
    +----+----------------+---------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    | 1  | m1.tiny        |     512 |    1 |         0 |     1 | True      |
    | 2  | m1.small       |    2048 |   20 |         0 |     1 | True      |
    | 3  | m1.medium      |    4096 |   40 |         0 |     2 | True      |
    | 4  | m1.large       |    8192 |   80 |         0 |     4 | True      |
    | 5  | m1.xlarge      |   16384 |  160 |         0 |     8 | True      |
    | 6  | custom.shrimpy |     512 |    2 |         0 |     1 | True      |
    | 7  | secret.monster | 1250000 |   10 |         0 |     8 | False     |
    +----+----------------+---------+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
    ```	
 
0. We need to tell OpenStack who should gain access to this project. Let's choose admin to start. Type the following to review the commands assocaited with **flavor**:

    `root@controller admin >` `nova help | grep flavor`
	
    ```
  flavor create  Create new flavor
  flavor delete  Delete flavor
  flavor list    List flavors
  flavor set     Set flavor properties
  flavor show    Display flavor details
  flavor unset   Unset flavor properties
  messaging flavor create  Create a pool flavor
  messaging flavor delete  Delete a flavor
  messaging flavor list  List available flavors
  messaging flavor show  Display flavor details
  messaging flavor update  Update a flavor's attributes
  server resize  Scale server to a new flavor
    ```  
    
0. Looks like we need to issue a **flavor access add** command. So, issue the following command:

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova help flavor-access-add`

	```
    Add flavor access for the given tenant.
	
    Positional arguments:
    <flavor>     Flavor name or ID to add access for the given tenant.
    <tenant_id>  Tenant ID to add flavor access for.
    ```

5. Discover the admin's username id (id) and tenant ID (teantId)
	
	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `keystone user-get admin` 

	```
	+----------+----------------------------------+
    | Property |              Value               |
    +----------+----------------------------------+
    |  email   |          root@localhost          |
    | enabled  |               True               |
    |    id    | e9483918caa940a48fe882ba092c7e0b | <-- admin username ID
    |   name   |              admin               |
    | tenantId | 300b2cc45c3846939e589310ae714e46 | <-- admin tenant ID (aaaa below)
    | username |              admin               |
    +----------+----------------------------------+
    ```

6. Copy the **admin tenantId** 

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova flavor-access-add 8 aaaa`  <-- replace **aaaa** with the tenantId from above
    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova flavor-list`

    >You have just allowed the tenant admin access to flavor #8, secret-monster. This is why admin can now see the flavor
 	
7. In the next several steps, we'll give aliceanderson's tenant access to the secret.monster flavor as well.   
     The commands you will use are all here, hold the control key and click: https://alta3.com/labs/openstack/keystone-commands/  

8. Discover aliceanderson's username id and tenantId	
	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `keystone user-get aliceanderson` <-- Discover aliceanderson's **tenantId**  
	
	```  
    +----------+----------------------------------+  
    | Property |              Value               |  
    +----------+----------------------------------+  
    |  email   |                                  |  
    | enabled  |               True               |  
    |    id    | 070c514afa1a463882008c36a269ff87 | <--Alice's username ID
    |   name   |          aliceanderson           |  
    | tenantId | 37d530d789ca43ddae4ad18b395218ae | <- Alice's tenant ID (xxxx below)
    | username |          aliceanderson           |  Example ONLY, please use your tenantId
    +----------+----------------------------------+  
    ```  
    >We now know aliceanderson's tenantId is a really big number, (37d530d789ca43ddae4ad18b395218ae), but unless we have a mind that can remember every customerID in our database, we probably do not remember that **37d530d789ca43ddae4ad18b395218ae** is **"acme_inc"**. Interestingly, since working on OpenStack, I constantly tell my wife that her new name is **"070c514afa1a463882008c36a269ff87"**, but she NEVER responds. All she would have to do is a `keystone user-get 070c514afa1a463882008c36a269ff87` and she would clearly see the association, but she refuses! I cannot figure out why...
	
9. Just an FYI. If you wanted to correlate this realy big number (these big numbers are called UUIDs) to the associated label, you could perform the following step (this step is not critical to continuing the lab, this is strictly a teaching step).
 
    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `keystone tenant-get xxxx` <-- Replace **xxxx** with alice's **tenantId** from above 

    ```
	+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
    |   Property  |                             Value                             |
    +-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
    | description | Acme Inc. is the world's leader in the production of widgets  |
    |   enabled   |                              True                             |
    |      id     |                37d530d789ca43ddae4ad18b395218ae               | <-- acme_inc's tenant (zzzz below)
    |     name    |                            acme_inc                           |
    +-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
    ```
	
10. Give acme_inc access to flavor secret.monster
	
	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova flavor-access-add 8 zzzz ` where zzzz = the tenant id from above

11. Check out if you were successfull!
	
    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `source keystonerc_aliceanderson`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_aliceanderson)]#` `nova flavor-list`
    
    >Alice Anderson should see the presence of secret.monster displayed, as the tenant acme_inc was given access to the project  

12. Find out if Chester Copperpot (a tenant of VaultTek) can see the project.
 
    `[root@controller ~(keystone_aliceanderson)]#` `source keystonerc_chestercopperpot`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)]#` `nova flavor-list`
	
    >Failed? Good! The user chestercopperpot is a member of VaultTek and VaultTek cannot see the flavor secret.monster because VaultTek has not been given access to the flavor secret.monster.

#### 3. Launching instances from the CLI

1. Let's try launching some instances from the CLI. SSH to your controller and log in as root, source yourself as the keystonerc_chestercopperpot user permission set.

2. See what flavor, images, and networks are available for use. Type the following commands:

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)]#` `nova flavor-list`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)]#` `glance image-list`

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)]#` `neutron net-list`
	
    ![net-id](https://i.imgur.com/lw5dWeS.png)

3. There are a few things we have not studied yet that we are working with here. We have not studied networking yet. Normally, we would first create a network for a tenant, and then launch that instance within that tenant's private network. We can study that later, for now, copy the UUID assocaited with the of the private network (it was revealed with the command **neutron net-list**).
 
4. Boot an instance called vt1 with the flavor custom.shrimpy, from the image cirros, and place it on the private network (more on networking is coming up)

	> NOTE: Instances typically will be placed on their own tenant network, and include a 'security group' (a set of IP rules); things we haven't yet studied (we'll get there in subsequent labs). Launching an instance without defining a security group, will result in using the 'default' security group, which denies all incoming traffic.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)]#` `nova boot --flavor custom.shrimpy --image cirros --nic net-id=<xxxxxxxxxxxx> vt1`
 
    > where `<xxxxxxxxx>` = the internal private_network_id that you cut and paste from the above command `neutron net-list`

 * Of course your output will be unique from what is listed above. Use your output to answer the following questions:
 * What is the task state?
 * What ID was this instance assigned?
 * What tenant does this instance belong to?
 * What name was this instance given?
 * What image was used to boot this instance? 
 
5. Display a list of the running instances within the current tenant

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)]#` `nova list`
    
 * What is the status?
 * What is the power state?
 * Hint: Issue the command again in a few minutes if they do not say "ACTIVE" and "Running" respectively.

6. Display information only about the running instance vt1 that was just created:

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_chestercopperpot)]#` `nova show vt1`

7. Log into the Horizon dashboard interface as `chestercopperpot` // `fa5tpa55w0rd` then navigate to:

 * Navigate to: Project > Compute > Instances
 * You've had some experience clicking around in Horizon instances before. Do it again! If nothing else, check out the log and console tabs for the instance.
 * This found by clicking on the instance name (vt1), then clicking on the log tab (or console tab).
	
8. That's it for this lab! We'll continue to explore manipulating instances, but feel free to exploring launching instances from the CLI or Horizon, or checking out other Nova commands while you wait.
