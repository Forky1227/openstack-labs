### Key-pairs
Key-pairs provide a secure connection that makes logging into an instance both easy and very secure. No password is necessary when using key-pairs for connectivity because the private-key itself is the "password"  In order to make the private key work, your public key must be installed onto your instance prior to being able to log into it. This lab teaches you this process using "rsa" key-pairs.
### One the beacchhead terminal:
1. `cd`
2. `cd .ssh`
3. `ll`  - *You will see four files:*
  - **authorized_keys** - are public keys from other users that are authorized to access your machine.  
  - **config** - An extremely handy list of shortcuts to SSH into other systems. Adding more hosts to this list makes it easy to navigate your cloud.
  - **id_rsa** is your private key. Give this key to no one and remember to keep it secure.
  - **id_rsa_pub** - This is your public key, which you will want to copy into your new instances so you can easily connect to them.
  - **KEY-PAIR:** Your **id_rsa** and your **id_rsa_pub** are a matched set. They go together. When you connect to an instance, these two files are the "key-pair" we are talking about. 
4. cat your public key. It will look like this:
   `cat id_rsa_pub`
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC0uAYWJ7pR8kz5Zar8wyQ9LAmzotuU70Q5M2TIMTmJ6Xsof046VcyHEOE3ZlboTHxrDpvjpstmhorkheHwl5IghZnUsQ9+YIcGsk6ds7n2mQ+b52E116b1Ewy7Ihj5UscguhOhsX95rhQx0c3sBl3dmqBsqj0h2P3C8d2HHDy3VyuLcHwosneegle8H5oM7U35VWFwdyyrAEEkSepCc9ENk2rjbKgeQX6d/5pQ5mcoogB15TmpleebgDQkpwzwHRpUqQqZDtVkgqyP9QlhjqfclcRKk6wFdYFplowkussCpn3aRrlPUjnEykWvNwNIBihiBqSjIJmWiU9ZMX5NZu5P1 student@beachhead
5. Using your mouse, copy your key from your terminal. It will look like the one above.
6. Within Compute, select **Access & Security**
7. Select **Key Pairs**
8. Select **Import Key Pair**
9. Enter the name **student-key** in the Key Pair Name
10. Paste the key you copied from **id_rsa_pub**
11. Click **Import Key Pair**
12 Click Instances
13. Launch an instance
14. Perform steps 13 - 30 below
