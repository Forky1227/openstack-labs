## Lab 20 - Launching Instances from the CLI - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### TUESDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to learn to how to launch instances from the CLI. This is a critical lab to understand, so don't hesitate to repeat it.

### Procedure

0. SSH to your controller as student.

    `student@beachhead:~#` `ssh controller`

0. Source the chester.rc file to issue commands as chestercopperpot

    `student@controller:~#` `source chester.rc`

0. Let's try launching some instances from the CLI. See what flavors are available for use to chestercopperpot.

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `openstack flavor list`
    
0. See what images are available for use. Remeber that the image is the bootable portion. 

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `openstack image list`
    
0. See what networks are available for use to attach the new VM to.

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `neutron net-list`

    ```
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
    | id                                   | name         | subnets                                              |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+

    +--------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
    ```
    
0. We have not studied networking yet. Normally, we would first create a virtual network, then launch that instance on that private network. We can study that later, for now, copy the UUID assocaited with the provider-net (it was revealed with the command **neutron net-list**).
 
0. Boot an instance called vt1 with the flavor custom.shrimpy, from the image cirros, and place it on the fabric network (more on networking is coming up)

	>
	NOTE: Instances typically will be placed on their own tenant network, and include a 'security group' (a set of IP rules); things we haven't yet studied (we'll get there in subsequent labs). Launching an instance without defining a security group, will result in using the 'default' security group, which denies all incoming traffic.

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `openstack server create --flavor custom.shrimpy --image cirros --nic net-id=<xxxxxxxxxxxx> vt1`
 
    > where `<xxxxxxxxx>` = the internal private_network_id that you cut and paste from the above command `neutron net-list`

    ```

 * Of course your output will be unique from what is listed above. Use your output to answer the following questions:
 * What is the task state?
 * What ID was this instance assigned?
 * What tenant does this instance belong to?
 * What name was this instance given?
 * What image was used to boot this instance? 
 
0. Display a list of the running instances within the current tenant

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `openstack server list`
    
 * What is the status?
 * What is the power state?
 * Hint: Issue the command again in a few minutes if they do not say "ACTIVE" and "Running" respectively.

0. Display information only about the running instance vt1 that was just created:

    `student@controller (chester) :~#` `openstack server show vt1`

0. Log into the Horizon dashboard interface as `default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd` then navigate to:

 * Navigate to: Project > Compute > Instances
 * You've had some experience clicking around in Horizon instances before. Do it again! If nothing else, check out the log and console tabs for the instance.
 * This found by clicking on the instance name (vt1), then clicking on the log tab (or console tab).
	
0. That's it for this lab! We'll continue to explore manipulating instances, but feel free to exploring launching instances from the CLI or Horizon, or checking out other OpenStack commands.
