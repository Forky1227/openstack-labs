### THURSDAY - &#x1F528;OPTIONAL&#x1F528;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students a basic introduction to git and git pull requests.  Many open source projects rely on git for decentralized collaboration, including OpenStack.

0. In a new tab, **[Create a Github account](https://github.com/join) or [Login](https://github.com/login)**

0. Navigate to the Alta3 OpenStack Glossary project by pasting the following URL into a new tab within your browser.

    `https://github.com/alta3/openstack-labs`      

0. Star the repository

    > Staring is like a bookmark on github.com,  you can view and search your stared repositories at [github.com/stars](github.com/stars)

0. **Fork the lab repository** into your account

0. Open a new terminal window open, and SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`

0. Change directory to .ssh
   `student@controller:~$` `cd .ssh`
   
0. edit the config file
    `student@controller:~$` `vim config` 
    
    Add the github.com config at the bottom of the file so that it looks like this when you are finsihed:
    
    ```
    Host beachhead
        Hostname 172.16.1.4
        User student
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Host controller
        Hostname 172.16.1.5
        User student
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
    Host compute1
        Hostname 172.16.1.6
        User student
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Host compute2
        Hostname 172.16.1.7
        User student
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Host github.com
        Hostname github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_mygithub
    ```
0. Create a new ssh key for your github account
    `student@controller:~$` `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsa_mygithub`

0. Cat the rsa public key you just created and keep it handy. You will need to paste it into your github account later.
   `student@controller:~$` `cat id_rsa_mygithub.pub`

0. Create a directory called myopenstack

    `student@controller:~$` `mkdir ~/myopenstack`

0. Change directories

    `student@controller:~$` `cd ~/myopenstack`

0. You must set up git with some default settings. These will be auto applied when you create a new version by performing a **git commit**. This command will auto apply your name to new git versions.

    `student@controller:~$`  `git config --global user.name "YOUR-GITHUB-NAME"`  <-- CUT AND PASTE WARNING
    
    > When I first met my wife, I introduced myself as "insert-name-here". She did not see any humor is this and to this day, she still does not. I, on the other hand, think this is extremely funny that she sees no humor in this. So, when you cut the above line, and in haste, paste it so that your official github name is "YOUR-GITHUB-NAME", please forgive me when I laugh out loud. Mistakes like this make it difficult for me to remain composed. If you made this mistake, you are in good company. Keep on stackin... 

0. This command will auto apply your email to new git versions. This email address does not need to be the same one you used to create your GitHub account.

    `student@controller:~$` `git config --global user.email "YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS"`

0. This command will display your default setting config.

    `student@controller:~$` `git config --list`

0. Tell the git application you would like to start version tracking on this directory.

    `student@controller:~$` `git init`

0. Dump your command line history to a file called history.txt

    `student@controller:~$` `history > history.txt`
    
0. Add the file history.txt to the staging area for version tracking.
    
    `student@controller:~$` `git add history.txt`
    
0. This command will show that the file history.txt is in the staging area, and has been prepared for version tracking.

    `student@controller:~$` `git status`
    
0. Create a new version with the **git commit** command. Add a comment about the file you will be tracking.

    `student@controller:~$` `git commit -m 'Contains my CLI history'`

0. From the homepage of your github account, click #1 on **+**, then click #2 the **New Repository** from the dropdown. ***If you are NOT logged in, you will NOT see this option!***

0. On your github account, create your new repository called "myopenstack".

0. On your github account, discover your remote URL and record it.

0. At your controller SSH sesssion, link your ~/myopenstack directory to the repository you just created.

    `student@controller:~$` `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`

0. This command tells git to push the latest commit (called master) to the pointer origin (which has been set as your GitHub account repository).

    `student@controller:~$` `git push origin master`

    `student@controller:~$` ` # respond to login`  
    `student@controller:~$` ` # respond to password`

0. Great! Go check your GitHub account, and the myopenstack repo should now contain a file called history.txt, which is every command you issued this week. If your account contains this file, you are done with this lab. If it doesn't, perform the next step.

#### ONLY PERFORM THESE STEPS IF THE LAST STEP FAILED!!

0. **Only if the above step fails**, most likely your github repository is out of sync or the remote target is incorrect. Try to resolve the issue as follows:

    > Let's make sure we have the correct target!, first, unset the value for origin.  

    `student@controller:~$` `git remote rm origin`
    
    > Now reset the value for origin.

    `student@controller:~$` `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`  

    > Pull down new files on the github repo in order to synchonize with the master branch.  

    `student@controller:~$` `git pull origin master`

    > This will sync github with your current directly

    `student@controller:~$` `git push origin master`

    > Now that you are synced with github, this should work
