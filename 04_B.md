#### 2. Getting User Credentials (source admin.rc)

So what we've all figured out by this point, is that setting flag on every CLI command involves far too much typing. Let's make our commands easier to issue by setting some environmental variables for our current bash session.  NOTE: If environmental vs shell variables, and parent vs child sessions are new terms for you, that is OK. There is a small section at the conclusion of this lab that will make it more clear.


0. Display the contents of the `admin.rc` file

    `[root@controller ~]#` 	`cat admin.rc`

    > Comments have been added to the output, your output will lack the comments (lines that begin with #).

    ```
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
    export OS_USERNAME=admin
    export OS_PASSWORD=alta3
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:35357/v3
    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    # Appends the CLI prompt with keystone_admin
    export PS1='[\u@\h \W(keystone_admin)]\$ '
    ```
    
    > The export commands within this file will mark each VAR for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands (i.e. make the local shell variable VAR global). Essentially, we can set all of our permissions in this file, source this file, and then not have to ever type our permissions again as they'll always be available to the bash environment.
    >
    > NOTE: The name of this file may change slightly depending on your environment. RDO deployments use the formatting structure keystonerc_$USER

#### 3. Creating a **chester.rc** file for Chester Copperpot of Vault Tek

Remember our buddy Chester Copperpot of Vault Tek? You should see him when you issued the previous command keystone user-list.

Let's make it easy for us to execute OpenStack commands as Chester Copperpot who is part of the project `vault_tek` at the CLI.

0. To make sure we're all on the same page, set the environmental variables found in `keystonerc_admin`

    `root@controller admin >` `source admin.rc`

0. List the keystone users

  `root@controller admin >` `openstack user list`

    ```

0. Look at the user chestercopperpot, and note his tenantID

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack user show chestercopperpot`

    ```
    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    | Field              | Value                            |

    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    ```
	
0. Find the tenant name for chester's tenantID value by comparing the tenantID above with the id below (should be vault_tek)
   
  `root@controller admin >`  `openstack project list`

    ```
    +----------------------------------+---------------+

    +----------------------------------+---------------+
    ```

0. While we are on a roll, lets try a few additional commands. Use **project show** discover the name if we only know the id!

    `root@controller admin >`  `openstack project show replace_with_ID_of_vault_tek`

    ```
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    | Field       | Value                            |
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    | description |                                  |
    | domain_id   | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
    | enabled     | True                             |
    | id          | 6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645 |
    | is_domain   | False                            |
    | name        | vault_tek                        |
    | parent_id   | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    ```

0. Alternatively the name vault_tek could also be used, but ideally it is best to get in the habit of working the UUIDs within an Openstack environment.

    `root@controller admin >`  `openstack project show vault_tek`

    ```
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    | Field       | Value                            |
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    | description |                                  |
    | domain_id   | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
    | enabled     | True                             |
    | id          | 6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645 |
    | is_domain   | False                            |
    | name        | vault_tek                        |
    | parent_id   | f7fec41f3beb41d29896c6aeb2c34b58 |
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    ```

0. Make a copy of the admin.rc file, then open it in vim (or nano) so we can edit it to reflect the credentials for the Openstack user chestercopperpot.

    `root@controller admin >` `cp admin.rc chester.rc`

0. Edit the following file with vim.

    `root@controller admin >` `vim chester.rc`

0. Edit **chester.rc** so it looks like the following.

0. Note the CLI changed. Run commands and see how the results differ from chester's perspective.

    `root@controller chester >` `openstack flavor list`
	
	> OK, this worked!

    `root@controller chester >` `openstack user list`
    
    > This should result in an HTTP 403 failure, as the user chestercopperpot does not have sufficient permissions to issue this keystone command.

0. Let's repeat the process for the user aliceanderson

    `root@controller chester >` `cp admin.rc alice.rc`

0. Use the editor vim (or nano) of your choice to edit the file.**

    `root@controller chester >` `vim alice.rc`  
	
0. Edit **alice.rc** so it looks like the following (or copy and paste is fine):

#### 4. Using the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard to assist in creating a keystonerc file for new user Doris Day of Vault Tek 

0. Log in to the OpenStack Horizon Dashboard as `default:chestercopperpot:fa5tpa55w0rd`

0. Click on **Project > Compute > Access & Security**

0. Click on the tab **API Access**

0. In the upper right corner, click on the button **Download OpenStack RC File v3**

    ![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/YUdErel.png)

0. This file will download to your browser's download folder. This file is just for your own reference, but take a moment to open it in your favorite text editor and read it over. The file you open will look similar to the one shown below. Again, reading over this file is just an FYI / reference step. Just a recommendation, if your "favorite" text editor is Microsoft Notepad or Microsoft Word, then it is recommended you take 2 minutes and go [download Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.8.2.html). It is a great utility for quickly editing simple text files.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # To use an OpenStack cloud you need to authenticate against the Identity
    # service named keystone, which returns a **Token** and **Service Catalog**.
    # The catalog contains the endpoints for all services the user/tenant has
    # access to - such as Compute, Image Service, Identity, Object Storage, Block
    # Storage, and Networking (code-named nova, glance, keystone, swift,
    # cinder, and neutron).
    #
    # *NOTE*: Using the 3 *Identity API* does not necessarily mean any other
    # OpenStack API is version 3. For example, your cloud provider may implement
    # Image API v1.1, Block Storage API v2, and Compute API v2.0. OS_AUTH_URL is
    # only for the Identity API served through keystone.
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:5000/v3

    # With the addition of Keystone we have standardized on the term **project**
    # as the entity that owns the resources.
    export OS_PROJECT_ID=6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME="vault_tek"
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME="default"
    if [ -z "$OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME" ]; then unset OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME; fi

    # unset v2.0 items in case set
    unset OS_TENANT_ID
    unset OS_TENANT_NAME

    # In addition to the owning entity (tenant), OpenStack stores the entity
    # performing the action as the **user**.
    export OS_USERNAME="chestercopperpot"

    # With Keystone you pass the keystone password.
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT

    # If your configuration has multiple regions, we set that information here.
    # OS_REGION_NAME is optional and only valid in certain environments.
    export OS_REGION_NAME="RegionOne"
    # Don't leave a blank variable, unset it if it was empty
    if [ -z "$OS_REGION_NAME" ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi
    ```
 
    >This file is a bit fancier than the previous one we studied, but it is well commented. There are two key differences between this file and ours:
    >
    > 1) The first is that this file will require the user to enter their password instead of storing it locally as plain-text. In production, this is desirable, as asking users to enter their password will prevent admins from having to manage security and permissions on user files because they contain plain-text passwords.
	>
    > 2) The second difference is that this file also sets some additional environmental variables, which could be problematic, as our other .*rc files do NOT set these variables. If we source back to another user without first unsetting these variables, we might get ourselves into trouble. So instead of using this file, let's just borrow the piece of code that asks the user for the password. It is shown below for reference:

    ```
    # With Keystone you pass the keystone password. 
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    ```
	
0. We're done in Horizon for now. Return to your SSH session with the controller and source admin.rc

    `root@controller chester >` `source admin.rc`

0. Let's create a new user (Doris Day) within the vault_tek project (tenant) and then create a source file that prompts for a password.

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack user create --domain default --project vault_tek  --password fa5tpa55w0rd --email "doris@day.com" dorisday`

0. You should recieve a 401 error. Hmm. Let's try troubleshooting what is wrong. Issue the following command.

    `root@controller admin >` `printenv | grep OS_`

    ```
    OS_PROJECT_ID=6417af4dea224c5999e89a7634d27645
    OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
    OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
    OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
    OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    OS_PASSWORD=alta3
    OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:35357/v3
    OS_USERNAME=admin
    OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    ```
    
0. Examine the output. Do you see what is wrong? It looks like chester.rc set a new variable, **OS_PROJECT_ID**, the UUID of which does not mach the admin's project UUID. Issue the following command to fix that...

    `root@controller admin >` `unset OS_PROJECT_ID`
    
0. Okay, try issuing that command again, this time it should work!

    `root@controller admin >` `openstack user create --domain default --project vault_tek  --password fa5tpa55w0rd --email "doris@day.com" dorisday`

    ```

    +--------------------+----------------------------------+
    ```
	
8. Create a file we can source for Doris Day of Vault Tek.

   `root@controller admin >` `vim doris.rc`

9. Edit `doris.rc` so it looks like the following:

    <pre>
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME="vault_tek"
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME="default"
    if [ -z "$OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME" ]; then unset OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME; fi
    unset OS_TENANT_ID
    unset OS_TENANT_NAME
    export OS_USERNAME="dorisday"
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_REGION_NAME="RegionOne"
    if [ -z "$OS_REGION_NAME" ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi
    </pre>

0. Confirm that the file was saved correctly, by displaying the output with cat, and then source doris.rc

    `root@controller admin >` `source doris.rc`

    `Please enter your OpenStack Password:` `fa5tpa55w0rd`

    - **Q1: Is this mechanism, prompting for a password, more secure? Why or why not?**
      - A1: In theory, yes. A user being prompted for a password is more secure than letting a password sit in a plain text document where proper read permissions and encryption may or may not be applied. Regardless, anytime the **export** command is used to set an environmental variable in a linux shell, securing that shell session should be a primary concern. 
	
0. Make sure the file works. Test by issuing a CLI command requiring authentication.

    `root@controller doris >` `openstack flavor list`
    
    > If output like this is displayed, then it worked!

	> Great job! You are all done with this lab. If you are done early, go onto the next section. It will teach you a little bit more about what is going on when you run the `source` command. 

#### 5. OPTIONAL: Linux variables

In OpenStack, we learned that we could type out the `--os-tenant-name`, `--os-user-name`, `--os-password`, and `--os-auth-url` along with every command, or we could set these values so they persist. If you are not a master of the CLI, you might be curious about how this worked! Understanding how it works might also help you in troubleshooting. After all, what if you ran a source file (set environmental variables), and wish you could un-run that source file (unset environmental variables). 

Variables can be of two basic types: shell variables, or environmental variables. Shell variables are only available within the current session, whereas environmental variables are available to the current session, as well as any spawned sessions. What is a session? You're in one right now. The Bash shell that you are sitting at is a 'session'. If you were to type `bash`, you'd launch another session that would be considered a 'child' session, where your current session would be the 'parent'.

If a child session is spawned by a parent session, environmental variables will be made available to the child sessions, whereas a shell variable will not. To better understand the difference, perform this quick procedure; define a shell variable, and then an environmental variable within parent and child bash shells.

0. Create a shell variable within the current session. Convention says it should be all caps. Because the string we've defined includes a bang, we are using single quotes to surround 'Hello OpenStack!'.

    `root@controller doris >` `LEARNING_VAR='Hello OpenStack!'`
	
0. Great! We can confirm that this is a shell variable that will not be passed down to child processes by grepping within output from set

    `root@controller doris >` `set | grep LEARNING_VAR`
	
0. LEARNING_VAR='Hello OpenStack!' should be displayed. Now confirm it is NOT an environmental variable by performing the same procedure with printenv.

    `root@controller doris >` `printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`
	
    > No output should be returned, as printenv will only print environmental variables.

0. Let's take a moment to demonstrate how to access any shell or environmental variable. When the shell encounters a `$` sign, it takes it to mean that it should substitute the value of the variable when it comes across it. Type the following command.

    `root@controller doris >` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    > The string Hello OpenStack! should be displayed.

0. If you type 'bash', you'll spawn a child shell. Think of this as accessing a 'shell within a shell'. Within this child session our variable, `$LEARNING_VAR`, should not be available.

    `root@controller doris >` `bash`

    `root@controller doris >` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    > No output should be displayed. 
    > Hopefully, why no output was display is clear. This is a child session, and was not passed the previous shell variables. Remember, shell variables are only good for the current shell. Type the following to test this assertion.
	
0. Type exit to close the child session and return to the original session.

    `root@controller doris >` `exit`

    `root@controller doris >` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`
	
    > Once again, the string Hello OpenStack! should be displayed, as we have returned to the parent shell (the shell we started in).

0. Okay. So to recap, LEARNING_VAR is currently a shell variable, but we can make it an environmental variable by using the export command. Let's also change the value of $LEARNING_VAR from `Hello OpenStack!` to `OpenStack Hello!`.

    `root@controller doris >` `export LEARNING_VAR='OpenStack Hello!'`

    `root@controller doris >` `printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`
	
0. Now, let us run the same experiment and observe our minor change. Once again, spawn a child shell.

    `root@controller doris >` `bash`

    `root@controller doris >` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`
 
    > `OpenStack Hello!` should be displayed. 

0. Confirm that it is still set as an environmental variable.

    `root@controller doris >` `printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`
	
0. Now let's set an environmental variable from within our current child shell.

    `root@controller doris >` `export NEW_LEARNING_VAR='Bonjour OpenStack!'`
	
0. Issue the following commands to confirm that it was indeed set as an environmental variable. Then exit the child session, and return to the parent shell.

    `root@controller doris >` `printenv | grep NEW_LEARNING_VAR`

    `root@controller doris >` `exit`

0. Now see if the environmental variable NEW_LEARNING_VAR is still available.

    `root@controller doris >` `printenv | grep NEW_LEARNING_VAR`
   
    > No output is returned. This is because `NEW_LEARNING_VAR` was an environmental variable set in the child shell. Emphasis on the word 'was', because when we exited our child shell, that environmental variable was destroyed.

0. The original variable, LEARNING_VAR can be changed back into a shell variable (demoted), by using export and the -n flag.

    `root@controller doris >` `export -n LEARNING_VAR`

0. Test that it is no longer a global variable, but still a shell variable

    `root@controller doris >` `printenv | grep LEARNING_VAR`

    > No output will be shown as LEARNING_VAR is no longer an environmental variable.

    `root@controller doris >` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    > OpenStack Hello! should be displayed, as LEARNING_VAR is now a shell variable.
    
    `root@controller doris >` `set | grep LEARNING_VAR`
    
    > `LEARNING_VAR='OpenStack Hello!'` will be displayed, confirming `LEARNING_VAR` exists as a shell variable.

16. A shell and environmental variable can be completely removed by issuing the unset command.

    `root@controller doris >` `unset LEARNING_VAR`

    `root@controller doris >` `echo $LEARNING_VAR`

    > Nothing will be displayed, as `LEARNING_VAR` has been unset

  	`root@controller doris >` `set | grep LEARNING_VAR`
	
    > Nothing will be displayed.
