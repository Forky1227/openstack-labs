#### 4. Creating a Project at the CLI (using python-openstackclient)

Earlier in this lab, there was mention of the python-openstackclient. The python-openstackclient is trying to unite all of the OpenStack services on a single platform with a common set of commands. Previously, commands were issued to clients customized to work with a single service (i.e. 'keystone user-create' or 'nova stop vm1' and so on...)

The following is a list of the steps you would take to utilize the python-openstackclient in order to create the project 'the_shire', as well as the user 'gandalf'.

1. SSH into your controller as root (if you are not already)

2. If you are not sourced as admin already, issue the following command:
	
	`[root@controller]#` `source keystonerc_admin`

3. Start the python-openstackclient
	
    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack`

	> Within the python-openstackclient, you'll be issuing commands as admin since the admin permissions were set when you executed `openstack`

4. Get a sense of the commands you can issue:

	`(openstack)` `help`

5. Issue the following commands to create the project, and then create the user `gandalf` with the password `noneshallpass`

    `(openstack)` `project create the_shire`

    `(openstack)` `user create gandalf --project the_shire --password noneshallpass --email gandalf@theshire.example`
	
	`(openstack)` `exit`

6. Log in to the Horizon interface as `gandalf` // `noneshallpass`

 * If you have forgotten how to get to Horizon, simply navigate to your FQDN in a web browser
 
 * The login should work! If it did, good job! If other students are still working, feel free to play around in the python-openstackclient a bit more.
