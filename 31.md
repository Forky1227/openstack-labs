### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students a basic introduction to git and git pull requests.  Many open source projects rely on git for decentralized collaboration including OpenStack.

#### A. Setup Github Account (You are advised to use a personal email address for this!)

0. In a new tab, **[Create a Github account](https://github.com/join) or [Login](https://github.com/login)**

0. Navigate to the Alta3 OpenStack Glossary project by pasting the following URL into a new tab within your browser.

    `https://github.com/alta3/openstack-labs`      

0. Star the repository

    > Staring is like a bookmark on github.com,  you can view and search your stared repositories at [github.com/stars](github.com/stars)

#### B. Fork the lab repository

0. **Fork the lab repository** into your account

#### C. Install git on the controller

0. You likely already are connected to your controller, but if not, sign into the CLI of your controller. The steps we will issue will be to Ubuntu (Linux) as well as the applciation git. Therefore, it does not matter Keystone permissions you have or do not have. For consistancy, the admin account is shown as being used.

0. Create a directory called myopenstack

    `student@controller:~$` `mkdir ~/myopenstack`

0. Change directories

    `ender@controller admin >` `cd ~/myopenstack`

0. You can set up git with some default settings. These will be auto applied when you create a new version by performing a **git commit**. This command will auto apply your name to new git versions.

    `ender@controller admin >` `git config --global user.name "--- Place your name here ---"`

0. This command will auto apply your email to new git versions. This email address does not need to be the same one you used to create your GitHub account.

    `ender@controller admin >``git config --global user.email "---your_email@example.com---"`

0. This command will display your default setting config.

    `ender@controller admin >` `git config --list`

0. Tell the git application you would like to start version tracking on this directory.

    `ender@controller admin >` `git init`

0. Dump your command line history to a file called history.txt

    `ender@controller admin >` `history > history.txt`
    
0. Add the file history.txt to the staging area for version tracking.
    
    `ender@controller admin >` `git add history.txt`
    
0. This command will show that the file history.txt is in the staging area, and has been prepared for version tracking.

    `ender@controller admin >` `git status`
    
0. Create a new version with the **git commit** command. Add a comment about the file you will be tracking.

    `ender@controller admin >` `git commit -m 'Contains my CLI history'`

#### D. CREATE REPOSITORY on your github account called 'myopenstack'

0. From the homepage of your github account, click #1 on **+**, then click #2 the **New Repository** from the dropdown. ***If you are NOT logged in, you will NOT see this option!***

0. On your github account, create your new repository called "myopenstack".

0. On your github account, discover your remote URL and record it.

0. At your controller SSH sesssion, link your ~/myopenstack directory to the repository you just created.

    `ender@controller admin >` `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`

0. This command tells git to push the latest commit (called master) to the pointer origin (which has been set as your GitHub account repository).

    `ender@controller admin >` `git push origin master`

    `ender@controller admin >` ` # respond to login`  
    `ender@controller admin >` ` # respond to password`

0. Great! Go check your GitHub account, and the myopenstack repo should now contain a file called history.txt, which is every command you issued this week. If your account contains this file, you are done with this lab. If it doesn't, perform the next step.

#### E. ONLY PERFORM THESE STEPS IF THE LAST STEP FAILED!!

0. **Only if the above step fails**, most likely your github repository is out of sync or the remote target is incorrect. Try to resolve the issue as follows:

    > Let's make sure we have the correct target!, first, unset the value for origin.  

    `ender@controller admin >` `git remote rm origin`
    
    > Now reset the value for origin.

    `ender@controller admin >` `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`  

    > Pull down new files on the github repo in order to synchonize with the master branch.  

    `ender@controller admin >` `git pull origin master`

    > This will sync github with your current directly

    `ender@controller admin >` `git push origin master`

    > Now that you are synced with github, this should work
