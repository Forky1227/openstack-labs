### Lab Duration: 10 minutes

### Lab Objective

0. Throughout the rest of the course, you'll find our documentation uses the vim text editior, however, you may use either **nano** or **vim**. If you have not used either, Alta3 Research recommends you skip **nano**, and learn to use **vim**.

  > Vim is the editor of choice for many developers and power users. It's a "modal" text editor based on the vi editor written by Bill Joy in the 1970s for a version of UNIX. It inherits the key bindings of vi, but also adds a great deal of functionality and extensibility that are missing from the original vi. 

  > In most text editors, the alphanumeric keys are only used to input those characters unless they're modified by a control key. In vim, the mode that the editor is in determines whether the alphanumeric keys will input those characters or move the cursor through the document.

0. Review the following **vim** commands.

  - **To start editing changes by entering the --INSERT-- mode:**
    - press `i`
  
  - **Top stop editing and return to command mode:**
