### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to create and work with groups. Groups are designed to manage access and assign roles to multiple members at once. Groups contain some number of users, all of which belong to some domain. Roles can be applied to groups, which are then inherited by those users.

Again, for these to function properly, we'd want to administer the various policy.json files. However, this lab will give you practice creating and administering groups with the python-openstackclient.

### Procedure

0. Back to the terminal. Time to create a group. Groups are collections of users that belong to some domain. Users can be added or removed from groups. Roles can then be applied to groups, which are inherited by the users belonging to those groups. Let's create a group called `engineers` within the default domain.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group create --domain default engineers`
    
0. Let's create a group called `technicians`.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group create --domain default technicians`

0. List all of the groups now available for us to work with

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group list`
       
0. We could pretend that maybe engineers have elevated permissions, where as technicians have permissions restricting them to only those activities relating to basic functions of VMs. Let's add aliceanderson to the engineers group.

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group add user engineers aliceanderson`

0. Confirm alice belongs to the group called **engineers**

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack group contains user engineers aliceanderson`
    
0. Add the role **heat_stack_owner** to the group

    `student@controller (admin) :~$` `openstack role add --domain default --group engineers heat_stack_owner`
    
    >
    No special output will be produced

0. Openstack role opens
