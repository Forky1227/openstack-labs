## Lab 24_B - Floating IP Addresses - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### WEDNESDAY

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to explore how floating IP addresses work...

### Procedure

1. Create a cirros instance on demo-net, called "pinger" and take note of this instance's IP address. Make sure to assign a security-group that permits ssh and icmp.
2. Using the no-vnc console on horizon, try to ping that IP address from Beachhead and notice that you CANNOT PING the instance!
    - Why?
    - Could it be that the router connected to 192.168.30.0/24 is a NAT? (The answer is yes)
3. ssh into pinger and ping beachhead. It works!  
   - why? 
   - Is demorouter looking like a NAT now? (The answer is yes)
4. On horizon assign a floating ip address to pinger

5. From beachhead, ping the floating ip address that you see on float-4.png.  It works!
   - why?
   - Is demorouter now looking like a 1:1 NAT (the answer is yes)
6. Does "pinger" instance know that it has a floating IP address? Let's find out.
7. ssh into the floating ip address of pinger
8. run `ip link show` and note that the floating ip address does not appear.
9. So "pinger" has NO IDEA that it has a floating ip address? (Yes, it has no idea)
10. Obtain a floating ip address for later use.
