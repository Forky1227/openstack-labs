### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to offer some exposure to using the Glance (Image) service. In this lab, a CirrOS image has already been downloaded and named. We will launch an instance with it. 
 
We keep talking about CirrOS. If it hasn't been explained already, CirrOS is a minimal (CirrOS < 15Mb) Linux distro that was designed for testing cloud instances (such as those on an OpenStack compute node). Take a minute, and check out all of the CirrOS downloads available by navigating to: http://download.cirros-cloud.net/.

Be aware that if your deployment is using QEMU or KVM, OpenStack recommends that you use images using the qcow2 format. The most recent 64-bit qcow2 image is available at http://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.4/cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img

#### 1. Creating a new image with glance at the CLI

0. SSH to your controller and log in as root (you might use PuTTy for this)

0. Once logged into the controller, issue the following command:

	`ender@controller admin >` `source admin.rc`

0. Retrieve a list of openstack commands relating to the Glance image service 

	`ender@controller admin >` `openstack help | grep image`

0. Ask glance to retrieve the image list

	`ender@controller admin >` `openstack image list`

0. Download the cirros operating system

	`ender@controller admin >` `wget https://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.4/cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img --no-check-certificate`

0. Create a new image with cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img with the name cirros_alph
	
	`ender@controller admin >` `openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --public --file cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img cirros_alpha`
  
0. Once again retrieve an image list and see the newly added image

	`ender@controller admin >` `openstack image list`

0. Launch an instance from the command line with the new instance cirros_alpha:

	`ender@controller admin >` `neutron net-list`
	
	* Highlight the id of the fabric network 
	
	`ender@controller admin >` `openstack server create --flavor custom.shrimpy --image cirros_alpha --nic net-id=<fabric_network_id> admin_box`
	
0. Log into the Horizon dashboard as `default:admin:alta3`

0. Navigate to **Project > Compute > Instances**

0. Confirm that the VM instance **admin_box** is running
 
0. That's it for this lab! Feel free to check out the Additional Learning / References listed below
