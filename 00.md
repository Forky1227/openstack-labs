### Lab 00 - Student Setup

### Lab Objective


The objective of this lab is to instruct students on how to access their lab environment from a Windows or Apple platform. All you will need to do the labs is a browser. Labs have been tested with Google Chrome and Firefox. 

### Procedure

0. Here is your OpenStack lab environment:

0. While **holding down the control key**, click the link with your name to connect to Horizon. If your name is not here contact us ASAP. 

    Openstack Labs: http://alta3.com/labs

    | Your Horizon FQDN - My Instructor is Mark Stephens | "Beachhead" user | ssh to "Controller" |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |http://username.alta3.training | username | `ssh root@username.alta3.training`

    
3. If your default browser is Chrome or firefox, while **holding down the control key**, click: https://alta3.com/beachhead to connect to your Lab Desktop. If your default browser is IE, then cut and paste `https://alta3.com/beachhead` into a new chrome or firefox browser window.
 
4. Answer the following questions to confirm that you understand the lab environment:
    - **Q1: How many browser tabs will you have open to do these labs?**
      - A1: Three. One for the lab manual (https://alta3.com/labs/openstack), one for terminal access (https://alta3.com/beachhead), and one for Horion (https://**LAST_NAME**.alta3.training)
    - **Q2: When you are asked to connect via command line, will everyone use the same URL?  If so, what is it?**
      - Q2: Yes. Everyone will use (https://alta3.com/beachhead) as a 'hop of point' into the CLI of their own controller.
    - **Q3: When you connect to OpenStack Horizon, what URL will you browse? (Hint, find your name on the table above)**
      - Q3: The OpenStack Horizon Dashboard is available via (https://**YOUR_LAST_NAME_HERE**.alta3.training)
    - **Q4: How many nodes are in your OpenStack lab environment?**
      - Q4: Four - Controller, Networking, Compute1, and Compute2
    - **Q5: Where will VMs run?**
      - Q5: VMs will always run on compute nodes, never on the Controller or Networking nodes.
