## Lab 24_B - Floating IP Addresses - &#x1F528;OPTIONAL&#x1F528;

### WEDNESDAY

### Lab Objective

Throughout the rest of the course, you'll find our documentation uses the vim text editior, however, you may also use **nano**. If you have not used either, Alta3 Research recommends you skip **nano**, and learn to use **vim**.

  > Vim is the editor of choice for many developers and power users. It's a "modal" text editor based on the vi editor written by Bill Joy in the 1970s for a version of UNIX. It inherits the key bindings of vi, but also adds a great deal of functionality and extensibility that are missing from the original vi. 

  > In most text editors, the alphanumeric keys are only used to input those characters unless they're modified by a control key. In vim, the mode that the editor is in determines whether the alphanumeric keys will input those characters or move the cursor through the document. This is what is meant by 'modal'. When you first enter vim, you enter in the command mode.

### Procedure
### Floating IP Addresses.

1. Create a cirros instance on demo-net, called "pinger" and take note of this instance's IP address. Make sure to assign a security-group that permits ssh and icmp.
2. Using the no-vnc console on horizon, try to ping that IP address from Beachhead and notice that you CANNOT PING the instance!
    - Why?
    - Could it be that the router connected to 192.168.30.0/24 is a NAT? (The answer is yes)
3. ssh into pinger and ping beachhead. It works!  
   - why? 
   - Is demorouter looking like a NAT now? (The answer is yes)
4. On horizon assign a floating ip address to pinger

5. From beachhead, ping the floating ip address that you see on float-4.png.  It works!
   - why?
   - Is demorouter now looking like a 1:1 NAT (the answer is yes)
6. Does "pinger" instance know that it has a floating IP address? Let's find out.
7. ssh into the floating ip address of pinger
8. run `ip link show` and note that the floating ip address does not appear.
9. So "pinger" has NO IDEA that it has a floating ip address? (Yes, it has no idea)
10. Obtain a floating ip address for later use.
