### Lab Duration: 20 minutes

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students a basic introduction to administering an OpenStack cloud. Although you install each OpenStack service separately, the OpenStack services work together to meet your cloud needs: Identity, Compute, Image service, Block Storage, Networking (neutron), Object Storage, Orchestration, and Telemetry. These services may be distributed or local to one another, but in all instances, after you have authenticated yourself through Identity (keystone), you use OpenStack APIs to create and admin OpenStack cloud resources.

#### 1. Servers and Nova Services

Using some basic CLI tools can help give you a sense of the shape of your OpenStack cloud; number of servers, the health of each server (Up / Down), and what services are running where.

1. SSH to your controller, log in as ender (this was covered in lab 00), and then issue the following command. 

    `[ender@controller]#` `source admin.rc`

```
    ender@controller admin > 
```

2. List the current services

   `ender@controller admin >` `openstack service list --long`

```

```
  - *Question:* Notice that each line had both an ID and a Name.  Is the ID globally unique?
    - Answer: YES!
  - *Question:* Is the Name Unique?
    - *Answer:* No, no, no, no, NO!
  - *Question:* Why are you making such a big deal about this?
    - *Answer:* If you want to refer to a specific item *ALWAYS* use the ID, the Name may refer to many items
    - *Question:* You mean two different ITEMS could have the same name???
      - *Answer:* YES!
      - *Question:* So how do I tell them apart?
        - *Answer:* Refer to items by the *ID* and try not to give things the SAME NAME just because OpenStack will allow you to do that
  - *Question:* Do the IDs above match the IDs you see on your screen?
    - *Answer:* No, IDs are *globally unique* 
  
  3. Look at the host names (to the left of .localdomain) to answer the following questions. We want a clear picture of the lab environment in your head, so ask the instructor if that picture is not crystal clear.
 
    - **Q1: How many compute servers are running?**
      - A1: Two compute servers running (compute1 and compute2)
    - **Q2: Where are the hostnames of the compute servers running?**
      - A2: The host names of the compute servers running are compute1.localdomain and compute2.localdomain 
    - **Q3 How many OpenStack cloud controllers are running?**
      - A3: One cloud controller (controller.localdomain)
    - **Q4 What is the current state of all of your services?**
      - A4: State of :-) means the service is up and running, whereas XXX means the service is no longer available.  

#### 2. Checking OpenStack Version

1. Return to your home directory, and then source the `keystonerc_admin` file. We will discuss what this file does in subsequent lessons. For right now, understand that it is a way to set what user is interacting with OpenStack at the CLI.

    `[root@controller]#` `cd`
	
	`[root@controller]#` `source keystonerc_admin`

    > This command will be explained in lab coming up, for right now, just know it has to do with setting proper permissions within the bash shell; a shortcut that tells the OpenStack cloud that we are the user admin. Your CLI prompt will also change

2. Display the service catalog for the OpenStack admin

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `keystone catalog | less`
	
    > For students who do not have much experience using the less command:
    - **Press q to quit -** Exit Less utility and return to the CLI
    - **Press CTRL + F -** Forward one window
    - **Press CTRL + B -** Back one window
    - Less utility cheat sheet (http://sheet.shiar.nl/less)
 
3. Answer the following questions:

    - **Q1: What IP address are these services being served from?**
      - A1: 192.168.0.10
    - **Q2: Whose IP address is this?**
      - A2: The controller's IP address
    - **Q3: What information is being conveyed in this 'service catalog'?**
      - A3: Different services that make up OpenStack, as well as the sockets for API endpoints are being described here.
    - **Q4: What are the names of the services currently in operation?**
      - A4: Compute, network, Volume(v2), Compute(v3), s3, image, metering, volume, ec2, object store, identity

4. List the nova service endpoints, does this output look familiar? 

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova service-list`

5. Collect the various version releases of your OpenStack services by issuing the following commands. What will be displayed is the version release of each service.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `keystone-manage --version`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova-manage --version`

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `glance-manage --version`

6. That version doesn't mean much until you click on the link and use the chart to correlate the release version to the name of an actual OpenStack release. Navigate in browser to: [OpenStack Releases](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Releases)

7. Look over the chart and notice that the version of Kilo is the same version that was being displayed each time you issued the `[$SERVICE]-manage --version` command.

 * OpenStack is a project with ambitious release dates. Take a minute to read over the notes concerning how the project is maintained.
 
8. That's it for this lab!
