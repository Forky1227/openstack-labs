### Lab XY - Using Horizon - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is for you to administer an OpenStack cloud with the Horizon Dashboard as both an admin and user. Let's role play a bit. Your new OpenStack deployment has gone live and you are ready to take on your first customers. These may be paying customers or perhaps a particular department within your organization.
 
For the purposes of this lab, we'll take two orders. The first order we'll provision via the OpenStack Horizon GUI, the second order, we'll complete with the CLI.

    - Order 1: Acme Inc; they would like two users, Alice Anderson, and Bob Barker, to be able to admin a small cloud for their company.
    - Order 2: VaultTek Enterprises; they would like Chester Copperpot to be able to admin a small cloud for their company.

### Procedure

0. To get started, if you are not already, **sign into the OpenStack web GUI** as the user admin (`http://<userid>.alta3.training`)

    ![login](https://i.imgur.com/xycVKAl.png)

0. Before we get started, **click on Project > Compute > Overview**

    ![overview](https://i.imgur.com/3u392KQ.png)
  
    > One more thing we can take note of: in the upper right part of the screen is the user you are currently logged in as. In the upper left side of the screen is the project you are currently working within. Look at the screenshot below. The project drop down menu and user drop down menu have both been clearly defined with large red arrows.

0. On the left hand side screen **click on Identity > Projects** The projects below in the red outline are ones you will soon add. They will not appear yet on your screen. Right now, all you should see are the tenants outlined in green below.

    >  Note: In OpenStack, users belong to Projects. Projects and tenants are interchangeable terms, used to refer to a group of users, and the total amount of cloud resources those users may consume (for, say, switching on instances). When OpenStack was new, compute had its own authentication mechanism and used the term 'project'. Authorization is now handled by the Keystone service, where it uses the word 'tenant'.
    > The admin tenant has their own default project.  This can be useful location to host virtualized services that are integrated into the OpenStack deployment.

0. To start, let's edit the project we are already a part of, On the Projects screen, in the Name column **click on the blue admin link**

0. You should now be on the 'Project Details: admin' page. In the drop down menu in the upper right, **select 'Edit Project'**.

0. In the Edit Project box that pops up, click on the **Quota tab**

0. **Change VCPUs from its current value**, to something absurd. After all, we're just trying to drive home a point. How about 2 million? Change the value of VCPU to read, VCPU: 2000000

0. Change Instances from its current value, to 1 million. **Change the value of instances to read, Instances: 1000000**

    ![mega vcpus](https://i.imgur.com/Dp4jTDh.png?1)

0. After you've made those two changes, **click the 'Save' button at the bottom of the screen.**

0. **Navigate to Project > Compute > Overview**

    > Examine the pie charts for Instances, and VCPUs. They've changed radically, but only to reflect the quota our project has been given. Hopefully it is clear that we couldn't possibly have just increased the resource capacity of our system by a factor of 100 million by simply changing the value of a variable.

0. To view actual available system resources, **click on Admin > System > Hypervisors**. You're welcome to go there now, but we'll devote another lab to exploring this section later. So for now, don't get too caught up in it.

    > What we want to take away from this section is that projects have associated maximum thresholds that are defined by the project's quotas. Quotas may exceed the actual resource capacity of the total cloud system, therefore the size of a project may be limited by the quota, or resource capacity of the system itself.
