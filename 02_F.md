0. Session timeout setting
    > If the 2 minute timeout is annoyingly short, you can change the Openstack timeout following this suggestion: https://ask.openstack.org/en/question/32206/horizon-session-timeout/

    > **SESSION_TIMEOUT**- This SESSION_TIMEOUT is a method to supercede the token timeout with a shorter horizon session timeout (in seconds). So if your token expires in 60 minutes, a value of 1800 will log users out after 30 minutes.
