### TUESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Setting flags on every CLI command involves far too much typing. Let's make our commands easier to issue by setting some environmental variables for our current bash session by creating **RC** files. If environmental vs shell variables, and parent vs child sessions are new terms for you, that is OK. There is a small OPTIONAL lab coming up that will make it more clear.

Every Linux distro names their files a little differently: openstackrc, openstackrc.sh, adminrc.sh, admin.rc. As long as you understand what an **RC** file does, you don't need to get hung up on naming conventions.

Some quick history... In the old Unix days, the runcom files on the CTSS system (1962-63), were fed into the machine via a startup script /etc/rc. This script file contained startup instructions for an application program (or an entire operating system). It was usually a text file containing commands that might have been invoked manually once the system was running, but instead, are to be executed automatically each time the system starts up. So, for those that may have been curious, rc stands for *runcom* or *run commands*.

### Procedure

0. We don't need any old terminal windows open, so close them all, and then open a new one. Once you have a new terminal window open, SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`

0. So an RC file containing admin privledges called *admin.rc* has already been created for you in the home directory. These are not created automatically, you **must** be able to create them for yourself if you're going to be become proficient at the CLI. Display the contents of the `admin.rc` file

    `student@controller:~$` `cat admin.rc`
