### THURSDAY - &#x1F528;OPTIONAL&#x1F528;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to give students a basic introduction to git and git pull requests.  Many open source projects rely on git for decentralized collaboration, including OpenStack.

0. In a new tab, **[Create a Github account](https://github.com/join) or [Login](https://github.com/login)**

0. Navigate to the Alta3 OpenStack Glossary project by pasting the following URL into a new tab within your browser.

    `https://github.com/alta3/openstack-labs`      

0. Star the repository

    > Staring is like a bookmark on github.com,  you can view and search your stared repositories at [github.com/stars](github.com/stars)

0. **Fork the lab repository** into your account

0. Open a new terminal window open, and SSH to controller. 

    `student@beachhead:/$` `ssh controller`

0. The CLI prompt should now read as follows:

    `student@controller:~$`
    
0. The next few steps are linux or git commands, therefore, it does not matter what Keystone permissions you have or do not have.

0. Create a directory called myopenstack

    `student@controller:~$` `mkdir ~/myopenstack`

0. Change directories

    `student@controller:~$` `cd ~/myopenstack`

0. You can set up git with some default settings. These will be auto applied when you create a new version by performing a **git commit**. This command will auto apply your name to new git versions.

    `student@controller:~$`  `git config --global user.name "--- Place your name here ---"`

0. This command will auto apply your email to new git versions. This email address does not need to be the same one you used to create your GitHub account.

    `student@controller:~$` `git config --global user.email "---your_email@example.com---"`

0. This command will display your default setting config.

    `student@controller:~$` `git config --list`

0. Tell the git application you would like to start version tracking on this directory.

    `student@controller:~$` `git init`

0. Dump your command line history to a file called history.txt

    `student@controller:~$` `history > history.txt`
    
0. Add the file history.txt to the staging area for version tracking.
    
    `student@controller:~$` `git add history.txt`
    
0. This command will show that the file history.txt is in the staging area, and has been prepared for version tracking.

    `student@controller:~$` `git status`
    
0. Create a new version with the **git commit** command. Add a comment about the file you will be tracking.

    `student@controller:~$` `git commit -m 'Contains my CLI history'`

0. From the homepage of your github account, click #1 on **+**, then click #2 the **New Repository** from the dropdown. ***If you are NOT logged in, you will NOT see this option!***

0. On your github account, create your new repository called "myopenstack".

0. On your github account, discover your remote URL and record it.

0. At your controller SSH sesssion, link your ~/myopenstack directory to the repository you just created.

    `student@controller:~$` `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`

0. This command tells git to push the latest commit (called master) to the pointer origin (which has been set as your GitHub account repository).

    `student@controller:~$` `git push origin master`

    `student@controller:~$` ` # respond to login`  
    `student@controller:~$` ` # respond to password`

0. Great! Go check your GitHub account, and the myopenstack repo should now contain a file called history.txt, which is every command you issued this week. If your account contains this file, you are done with this lab. If it doesn't, perform the next step.

#### ONLY PERFORM THESE STEPS IF THE LAST STEP FAILED!!

0. **Only if the above step fails**, most likely your github repository is out of sync or the remote target is incorrect. Try to resolve the issue as follows:

    > Let's make sure we have the correct target!, first, unset the value for origin.  

    `student@controller:~$` `git remote rm origin`
    
    > Now reset the value for origin.

    `student@controller:~$` `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME-HERE/myopenstack.git`  

    > Pull down new files on the github repo in order to synchonize with the master branch.  

    `student@controller:~$` `git pull origin master`

    > This will sync github with your current directly

    `student@controller:~$` `git push origin master`

    > Now that you are synced with github, this should work
