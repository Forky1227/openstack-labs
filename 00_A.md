### Lab 00 - Student Setup - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Welcome to the Alta3 OpenStack Labs! Before we get started, let's review some basics:

Each lab is structured with a *Title*, *Lab Objective*, and *Procedure*.

   - **Title** - Indicates if this lab is Required, Optional (Basic), or Optional (Advanced)
      - **Required - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;** - Marked with a Gold Star emoji. Everyone must do these labs! These labs build on one another, so don't skip any!
      - **Optional (Basic) - &#x1F528;OPTIONAL&#x1F528;** - Marked with a Hammer emoji. Do these labs if you are new to Linux or the Command Line Interface. Failure to do this labs by inexperienced users is garunteed to cause greater problems in other labs!
      - **Optional (Advanced) - &#x1F680;OPTIONAL&#x1F680;** - Marked with a Rocket Ship emoji. Do these labs if you're a Rocket Scientist and are looking for more than just the basics (i.e. "You're a wizard, Harry")
   - **Lab Objective** - Justifies why this is an important task to learn, and the ultimate goal of the procedure.
   - **Procedure** - Numbered steps to follow.

The objective of this lab is to instruct students on how to access their lab environment from a Windows, Linux, or Apple platform. All you will need to perform the labs is a browser. The flavor of the browser is upto you, but if you have any issues, it is recommended you first switch to Chrome or Firefox.

Although it is not required, the labs might be made a tad easier if you have a second monitor available for use.

### Procedure

0. Here is your OpenStack lab environment: 

	![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3-cloud-nets-001.png)

0. While **holding down the control key**, click the following link to gain access to your remote desktop "beachhead". https://alta3.com/beachhead
    
0. You should be connected to a screen that looks like the following:

	![Lab Environment](https://alta3.com/labs/images/alta3-lab-desktop-signin.png)

0. You now need to sign into your remote desktop environment. The sign-in name, and password will be provided by your instructor. Keep note of these, they will not change for the remainder of the course.

0. Now that you are signed in, we recommend you tap **F11** to place yourself in full-screen mode. Fullscreen mode will make the lab environment the easiest to control. This is where the second monitor will come in handy. Unfortunately, Micro$oft Edge (the new Internet Explorer browser packaged with Windows 10) doesn't allow a full screen mode. Again, if at all possible, we recommend using Firefox or Chrome to complete the OpenStack labs.
 
0. Answer the following questions to confirm that you understand the lab environment:
    - **Q1: How many browser tabs will you have open to do these labs?**
      - A1: One. The tab to my remote desktop environment (called 'beachhead'), and if possible, this tab should be in full screen mode.
    - **Q2: Can I use the Microsoft Edge browser to complete the labs?**
      - Q2: Yes. You CAN use Microsfot Edge to complete the labs, just like you CAN walk from Maine to Florida. However, there are better options such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
    - **Q3: If I get pulled out of class for an emergency, can I resume labs later this evening?**
      - Q3: Sure can! However, these labs do build on one another, so please focus on completing the labs during class time.
    - **Q4: How many nodes will you have access too within your OpenStack lab environment?**
      - Q4: Three OpenStack nodes (Controller, Compute1 and Compute2), as well as one jump-off point (beachhead). 
    - **Q5: Where will VMs run?**
      - Q5: VMs will always run on compute nodes, where the hypervisors are located, never on the Controller (or Neutron networking) nodes.
    - **Q6: What about a Networking Node?**
       - Q6: In production, we would fully expect to have a node dedicated to Neutron (networking). Afterall, networking is resource intense within a production environment! However, in lab, we won't have an, 'intense production environment', therefore, Neutron (networking) is running on the Controller node.
