##METADATA

0. Now let's set some metadata about our instance. Here I am using mtag1, but you can use anything. Try starting with the following:

	`ender@controller admin >` `nova meta $VAR_UUID set mtag1='vault_tek box'`
	
9. Look to see that your first metadata tag has been set.

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova show $VAR_UUID`
	
10. Now let's set a second metadata tag concerning our instance.

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova meta $VAR_UUID set mtag2='uh oh I set this tag incorrectly'`
	
11. Look to see that your second metadata tag has been set.

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova show $VAR_UUID`

12. Now remove the second metadata tag.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova meta $VAR_UUID delete mtag2`
	
13. Confirm the second metadata tag has been deleted.

	`[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `nova show $VAR_UUID`
