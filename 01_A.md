7. Launch and use the **python-openstackclient**

    >OpenStack is attempting to 'unite' all of the OpenStack commands inside of a common python 'wrapper', or a platform that allows you to issue a common set of commands for every OpenStack service. This is why CLI commands issued to the keystone-pythonclient are receiving deprecation warnings. Some people are using the openstack-pythonclient, and some are not, but we think it is important you know it exists.

    `[root@controller ~(keystone_admin)]#` `openstack`
	
	`(openstack)` `help`
	
    `(openstack)` `exit`

    >The permissions still apply! If you have sourced the `keystonerc_admin` file, then launch the **python-openstackclient**, then you are issuing commands to OpenStack as admin.
